# `Student Loan Risk Prediction with Deep Learning

## Summary of Findings
This project involves building a neural network model to predict student loan repayment success and discusses the creation of a recommendation system for student loans. Below are the key components and findings of the project.

## Project Components

### 1. Prepare the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model
- **Dataset Creation**:
  - Two datasets were created: a target dataset (y) that includes the "credit_ranking" column, and a features dataset (X) that includes all other columns.
- **Data Splitting**:
  - The features and target datasets were split into training and testing datasets to facilitate model training and evaluation.
- **Data Scaling**:
  - Scikit-learn's StandardScaler was used to scale the features data, ensuring that the neural network model receives data with standardized values.

### 2. Compile and Evaluate a Model Using a Neural Network
- **Model Creation**:
  - A deep neural network was created with appropriate parameters to handle the complexity of the dataset.
- **Model Compilation and Training**:
  - The model was compiled and fit using the accuracy loss function, the Adam optimizer, the accuracy evaluation metric, and a small number of epochs (50 or 100) to prevent overfitting.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - The model was evaluated using the test data to determine its loss and accuracy, providing insights into its performance.
- **Model Saving**:
  - The model was saved and exported to a Keras file named `student_loans.keras` for future use.

### 3. Predict Loan Repayment Success by Using the Neural Network Model
- **Model Reloading**:
  - The saved model was reloaded to ensure that the trained model could be used for making predictions without retraining.
- **Making Predictions**:
  - The reloaded model was used to make binary predictions on the testing data, identifying whether students are likely to repay their loans successfully.
- **Generating a Classification Report**:
  - A classification report was generated for the predictions and the testing data, providing detailed performance metrics of the model.

### 4. Discuss Creating a Recommendation System for Student Loans

#### Data Collection for the Recommendation System
To build a recommendation system for student loan options, I would collect data on student demographics (age, ethnicity, residency status), academic information (current level, major, GPA, expected graduation date), financial details (family and personal income, existing debt, credit score), loan preferences (amount needed, preferred term, interest rate tolerance, repayment flexibility), loan history (previous loans, repayment status, defaults), and loan provider information (available loan options, interest rates, terms, and provider reputation). This data is crucial for tailoring recommendations to individual student needs, ensuring financial viability, assessing risk, and providing a comprehensive view of suitable loan products.

#### Filtering Method for the Recommendation System
Based on the data I chose to use in this recommendation system, my model would use content-based filtering. Content-based filtering is ideal because it leverages the specific attributes of students (such as demographics, academic information, financial details, loan preferences, and loan history) to match them with suitable loan options. This method is appropriate given the highly personalized nature of student loans, where individual characteristics and preferences play a crucial role in determining the best loan products. Collaborative filtering would be less effective due to the unique financial and academic profiles of each student, and context-based filtering, while useful, is less relevant compared to the detailed personal and financial information required for accurate recommendations.

#### Real-World Challenges in Building a Recommendation System
While building a recommendation system for student loans, I would take into consideration two real-world challenges: data privacy and security, and maintaining accurate and up-to-date information. Handling sensitive personal and financial information raises significant privacy and security concerns, as it is crucial to comply with data protection regulations and secure the data against breaches to maintain trust and avoid legal repercussions. Additionally, ensuring that the information used is accurate and current is vital for providing relevant loan options. Outdated or incorrect data can lead to poor recommendations, causing financial distress for students and reputational damage for the service provider. Continuous data validation and updates are necessary to maintain the system's effectiveness.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the preparation of data, creation, and evaluation of a neural network model for predicting student loan repayment success. Furthermore, it discusses the key considerations and challenges in creating a recommendation system for student loans, ensuring it is tailored, accurate, and secure for students.
